## ðŸ“š What Today Learned

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow us to make decisions in our code based on certain conditions. Here are some key takeaways:

- **if Statement:** I learned how to use the `if` statement to execute a block of code if a condition is true.

- **else Statement:** I explored the `else` statement to provide an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is false.

- **else if Statement:** I understood how the `else if` statement can be used to evaluate multiple conditions in sequence.

- **Switch Statement:** I learned about the `switch` statement, which provides an efficient way to handle multiple conditions.

### Looping Statements

Looping statements are crucial for repeating actions in code. I covered the following looping statements:

- **for Loop:** The `for` loop allowed me to execute a block of code a specific number of times, making it suitable for iterating through sequences.

- **while Loop:** The `while` loop was introduced, which executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.

- **do...while Loop:** I explored the `do...while` loop, which is similar to the `while` loop but ensures that the block of code runs at least once.

### Working with Patterns

Working with patterns involves using loops and conditional statements to create various visual patterns or structures in your code. This not only enhances your problem-solving skills but also helps in understanding loop control and logic.

- [x] Learned about conditional statements.
- [x] Explored looping statements.
- [x] Practiced creating patterns using loops and conditionals.

## ðŸŒŸ What's Next

Day 3 was an exciting journey into the world of conditional and looping statements, along with pattern creation. In the upcoming days, I'll continue to build on these fundamentals, tackling more complex DSA topics, and working on practical coding challenges.

Stay tuned for more updates on my DSA learning journey!
