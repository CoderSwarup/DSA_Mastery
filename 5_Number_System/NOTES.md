## ðŸ“š What Today Learned

## What is Number Sysytem ?

Number System is a method of representing Numbers on the Number Line with the help of a set of Symbols and rules. These symbols range from 0-9 and are termed as digits. Number System is used to perform mathematical computations ranging from great scientific calculations to calculations like counting the number of Toys for a Kid or Number chocolates remaining in the box. Number Systems comprise of multiple types based on the base value for its digits.

# Number Systems in Computer

Number systems are a fundamental concept in computer science and digital electronics. They provide the basis for representing and manipulating data within computers. Understanding different number systems is crucial for low-level programming, computer architecture, and working with digital data. In this document, we'll explore the most common number systems used in computing.

## 1. Binary Number System

- **Base:** Binary is a base-2 number system, meaning it uses two symbols, typically 0 and 1.
- **Representation:** Binary is used to represent digital data and is fundamental in computer memory and processing.
- **Examples:** Binary numbers might look like 1010, 1101, 11110000.

## 2. Decimal Number System

- **Base:** Decimal is a base-10 number system, using ten digits from 0 to 9.
- **Representation:** Decimal is the system we commonly use for everyday calculations.
- **Examples:** Decimal numbers include 42, 3.14, and 1000.

## 3. Octal Number System

- **Base:** Octal is a base-8 number system, utilizing digits from 0 to 7.
- **Representation:** Octal is used in some computer systems and file permissions.
- **Examples:** Octal numbers may look like 34, 076, or 0275.

## 4. Hexadecimal Number System

- **Base:** Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, using digits 0-9 and letters A-F.
- **Representation:** Hexadecimal is often used in programming for memory addresses and binary data.
- **Examples:** Hexadecimal numbers include 1A, FF, or 0x3E.
