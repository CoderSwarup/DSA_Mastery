## ðŸ“š What Today Learned

## What is Switch Case Statement ?

The â€˜Switchâ€™ is a branching and control statement. It is just like a switchboard at home whichever thing we want to put on we have to press that switch on.

This is the basic structure of the â€˜switch-caseâ€™ statement. In the parenthesis of the switch, you can write some expression or a variable. But it can be either integer type, character type variable, or an expression. And for the different values of this expression, you can mention various cases.

## Is there any reason to use switch statement instead of if and elseif cpp

### Readability

- **Switch Statement:**

  - Provides a clear structure for comparing a variable against multiple constant values.
  - Concise when dealing with a large number of cases.

- **If-Else Statements:**
  - May become less readable as the number of conditions increases.

### Constant Expressions

- **Switch Statement:**

  - Requires constant expressions for case labels.

- **If-Else Statements:**
  - Can handle more complex conditions or dynamic expressions.

### Fallthrough

- **Switch Statement:**

  - Allows intentional fallthrough from one case to another.

- **If-Else Statements:**
  - No fallthrough by default, making behavior more predictable.

### Range Checks

- **Switch Statement:**

  - Suitable for simple conditions.

- **If-Else Statements:**
  - Better for range checks or more complex logic.

### Default Case

- **Switch Statement:**

  - Supports a default case for unmatched conditions.

- **If-Else Statements:**
  - Also allows for a default case.

### Performance

- Both constructs have similar performance, and modern compilers optimize code effectively.

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Default Execution</strong></td>
      <td>If the condition inside the if-statement is false, the code block within the else statement is executed.</td>
      <td>Executes the default statement if none of the cases match the provided condition.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Sequence of Execution</strong></td>
      <td>Executes the code block within the if or else statement based on the first true condition.</td>
      <td>Sequentially checks each case until a break statement is encountered or the end of the switch statement is reached.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Performance</strong></td>
      <td>Performance may decrease when handling multiple options due to sequential evaluation.</td>
      <td>Provides optimized performance when dealing with numerous options, executing faster than if-else statements.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Ease of Editing</strong></td>
      <td>May be challenging to edit when dealing with nested if-else statements.</td>
      <td>Easier to edit due to a straightforward structure.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Values Handling</strong></td>
      <td>Based on the constraints specified in the conditions.</td>
      <td>Relies on user inputs to match cases.</td>

## Where this switch case is useful?

Mostly it is useful for writing menu-driven programs. For example, if I take the example of notepad, there are the options like â€˜Fileâ€™ and inside this file option â€˜Newâ€™, â€˜Openâ€™, â€˜Saveâ€™, â€˜Save asâ€™ etc. For each option, we can define some code i.e. â€˜New â€“ 1â€™, â€˜Open â€“ 2â€™, and so on. So, depending on the value we will define a particular case in the switch statement. One thing is that in any case, we can again define the switch statement. Below are some key points of the switch statement.
